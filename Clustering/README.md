CS 383 Machine Learning Himanshu Gupta Assignment 2 README:

Task: Implement our own version of k-means to cluster data. In order to
visualize the cluster process, youâ€™ll generate a video. Choose a frame
rate that is natural for observing the changes in the association. Each
frame of the video will be a plot showing the current clustering. If X
has only 2 features, this will be a 2D plot. If it has 3 features
(either natively, or after PCA reduction), then this will be a 3D plot.

1)  CS383HimanshuGupta.pdf contains the answers of question 1 and
    question 2.

2)  Put "diabetes.csv" file in the same directory.

3)  Three video is attached with the submission with k=3,5,and 7.

4)  Hw2.m is the source code for the program.
